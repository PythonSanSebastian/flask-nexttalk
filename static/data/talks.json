        "The problem of introducing children to programming and computer science has\r\nseen growing attention in the past few years. Initiatives like Raspberry\r\nPi, Code Club, code.org, (and many more) have been created to help solve\r\nthis problem. With the introduction of a national computing curriculum in\r\nthe UK, teachers have been searching for a text based programming language\r\nto help teach computational thinking as a follow on from visual languages\r\nlike Scratch.\r\n\r\nThe educational community has been served well by Python, benefiting from\r\nits straight-forward syntax, large selection of libraries, and supportive\r\ncommunity. Education-focused summits are now a major part of most major\r\nPython Conferences. Assistance in terms of documentation and training is\r\ninvaluable, but perhaps there are technical means of improving the\r\nexperience of those using Python in education. Clearly the needs of\r\nteachers and their students are different to those of the seasoned\r\nprogrammer. Children are unlikely to come to their teachers with\r\nfrustrations about the Global Interpreter Lock! But issues such as\r\nusability of IDEs or comprehensibility of error messages are of utmost\r\nimportance.\r\n\r\nIn this keynote, Carrie Anne will discuss existing barriers to Python\r\nbecoming the premier language of choice for teaching computer science, and\r\nhow learning Python could be helped immensely through tooling and further\r\nsupport from the Python developer community.\r\n",

        "Given the dynamic nature of Python, some bugs tend to creep in our codebases. Innocents NameErrors or hard-to-find bugs with variables used in a closure, but defined in a loop, they all stand no chance in front of Pylint (http://pylint.org/).\r\nIn this talk, I'll present one of the oldest static analysis tools for Python, with emphasis on what it can do to understand your Python code.  Pylint is both a style checker, enforcing PEP 8 rules, as well as a code checker in the vein of pyflakes and the likes, but its true power isn't always obvious to the eye of beholder.  It can detect simple bugs such as unused variables and imports, but it can also detect more complicated cases such as invalid arguments passed to functions, it understands the method resolution order of your classes and what special methods aren't implemented correctly. Starting from abstract syntax trees, we'll go through its inference engine and we'll see how Pylint understands the logical flow of your program and what sort of type hinting techniques are used to improve its inference, including PEP 484 type hints. As a bonus, I'll show how it can be used to help you port your long-forgotten library to Python 3, using its new --py3k mode."

We will also look at the performance implications of logging. We will then cover best practices - how to structure logging, what to include in a log message, and how to configure logging for different use cases.\r\n\r\nWe will use the Python standard logging module to implement logging.

        "Software development is all about writing code that delivers additional value to a customer. Following the agile and lean approach this value created by code changes should be continuously delivered as fast, as early and as often as possible without any compromise on the quality. \r\nRemarkably, there is a huge gap between the development of the application code and the reliable and scalable operation of the application. As an example, most of the tutorials about web development with Flask or Django end by starting a local \u201cdummy\u201d server, missing out all the steps needed for production ready operation of the web service. Furthermore, as there is no \u201crocket science\u201d in-between, many proposals to bridge that gap from both sides, operations and developers start with sentences like: \u201cyou just have to...\u201d, a clear indication that it will cause problems later on and also a symptom of a cultural gap between developers and operations staff.\r\nIn this talk I will go through the complete delivery pipeline from application development to the industrial grade operation, clearly biased towards the \u201cDevOps\u201d mindset. Instead of presenting a sophisticated enterprise solution, I will outline the necessary building blocks for continuous delivery and fill them up with simple but working poor man's solutions, so that it is equally useful for professional and non-professional developers and operations engineers. After the talk you will know how to build such a continuous delivery pipeline with open-source tools like \u201cAnsible\u201d, \u201cDevpi\u201d and \u201cJenkins\u201d and I will share some of my day-to-day experiences with automation in general. Although many of the concepts are language agnostic I will focus on the ins and outs in a python universe and outline the pythonic way of \u201cget this thing running\u201d.\r\n"

Particular attention will be paid to where these diverge from the utopian way microservices are often described, and to the particular difficulties faced by Python developers trying to implement such systems. My goal is to share with attendees some mistakes we've made, some successful methods for growing gracefully, and Python-specific tools/libraries which can help with these problems.\r\n\r\nTo enjoy this talk, you should be aware of the basic vocabulary and concepts of HTTP-based services.

There are also libraries to access asynchronously the file system, resolve names with DNS, have variables local to tasks, read-write locks, etc. There are clients for AMQP, Asterisk, ElasticSearch, IRC, XMPP (Jabber), etc. (and even an IRC server!). There are asynchronous drivers for all common databases, and even for some ORMs. As expected, there are tons of new web frameworks based on asyncio. It's also possible to plug asyncio into Gtk, Qt, gevent, eventlet, gunicorn, tornado, etc.\r\n\r\nI will also discuss use cases of asyncio in production and benchmarks. Spoiler: asyncio is not slow.\r\n\r\nThe asyncio library also evolved to become more usable: it has a better documentation, is easier to debug and has a few new functions. There is also a port to Python 2: trollius.",

It explains the concept of coroutines, futures and ioloop, exposing Python 3 code for sample web tasks.

I'm happy to oblige and give a talk about this at the EuroPython!\r\n\r\nOther events I spoke at (selection):\r\n\r\n- 31C3 (Chaos Communication Congress) Hamburg: I gave a talk on quantum computing in front of 1.800 people, which received very positive feedback (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXtE0Zeszho)\r\n- PyCon Montreal - I spoke about data-driven code analysis in front of 1.000 people.

However starting a new Python project can be tiring if you decide to stick to best practices and plan on submitting it to PyPI. It requires great diligence and occasionally gets pretty cumbersome if you start new tools on a regular basis.\r\n\r\nWhy not just use a template for it? Cookiecutter is a CLI tool written in pure Python that enables you to do so. Not only is it working for Python code, but also markdown formats and even other programming languages.

I will present how to successfully combine open-source tools like Git, Jenkins, Buildout, Fabric, uWSGI, and South, in order to simplify the process and make it more reliable.

This transformative cycle uses Python big-hitters such as Scrapy, Pandas and Flask, the latter delivering data to Javascript's D3.\r\n\r\nWhile Python is fast becoming the goto language for data-processing/science, the visual fruits of that labour hit the wall of the web, where there is only one first-class language, Javascript. To develop a data-viz toolchain for the modern world, where web-presentation is increasingly mandated, making Python and Javascript play nicely is fundamental. This talk aims to show that the perceived wall between the two languages is actually a thin, permeable membrane and that, with a bare minimum of web-dev, one can get on with programming seamlessly in both.\r\n\r\n  [1]: http://kyrandale.com/blog/data-visualization-python-javascript/\r\n"

        "The past few years, we have made large strides to welcome more diverse people into our community.  You see better gender ratios in attendance numbers at Python conferences, the billed speakers, the amount of women-centric programs.  We can see the benefits of outreach.  But we're not done yet.\r\n\r\nWhile a lot of the Python community embraces the importance of being diverse, we haven't taken that mindset to our workplace.  From recruiting, we still hear, \"sure, we wanted to recruit women, but we couldn't find them\" and \"we only focus on quality here, not gender!\"  Within company cultures, we hear \"gender equality isn't a problem here!\" or \"women don't ask for a higher salary\" and to \"just lean in!\"\r\n\r\nThis talk will recount the diversity efforts of the past few years and quantify the effects on the Python community.  But this talk will also address the not-so-low-hanging fruit; the  deeper-rooted problems that still plague the community from inside where we work.  And it will talk the audience through actionable items to improve one's work place that welcomes more diversity."

        "So often, we've been encouraged to be smart in our development. \"Work smarter not harder!\" say the encouraging posters. But the desire to be smart, and be seen to be smart, is hurting. The design suffers, the code suffers, and it's hard to recruit developers smart enough to cope with the problems caused.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, I'm proposing an alternative to being smart: **_DumbDev_**. Let's use our brains for enjoyable, interesting things, rather than wrestling with code written for smart developers.\r\n\r\n**So what do I mean by _dumb_?**\r\n\r\nWell, I don't mean 'ignorant'. A clever person can be ignorant of some important information, and learn it. With ignorance, there is hope. I'm also not talking about its opposite, 'stupidity'. This occurs when someone is given the information or advice, and chooses to ignore it. Dumb isn't stupid. Nor is it silent, as in someone who can't speak.\r\n\r\nInstead, the picture I have is of one of the early computers: very small RAM, disk space measured in KB, and a woefully inadequate CPU. In other words, slow, with very little working memory and limited persistent storage. Hey, this describes my brain -- and I realise that's an asset!

I will write better software if I take this into account.\r\n\r\nSo, I'm a **_DumbDev_**, which means I can't hold in my mind the infamous [Plone Site class hierarchy][1] (see [Michele Simionato's article][2]). Rather than beat myself up about this, I can say, \"Hold on, maybe deep inheritance is a bad idea...\" There is some debate about the number of things we can think about simultaneously: it may be 7, 9, 5, 4 or even only 3. We can learn some tricks to appear to cope with more, but most of us can't easily do 38. \r\n\r\nHere's the first **_DumbDev_** rule, putting a sensible limit on complexity:\r\n\r\n> **1. All diagrams must fit on a Noughts and Crosses (Tic-tac-toe) board**.\r\n\r\n> _One central class/concept and up to eight things linked. Larger structures need to be subdivided._\r\n\r\nThere are seven further rules for me to explain in this talk. I will demonstrate the benefits of the **_DumbDev_** approach, with good and bad examples. At the end of the presentation, I hope you will realise that you're a better developer than you thought at the start. The next time it takes you two hours to debug a simple exception, you'll know that it's not you. It's because the system wasn't written using **_DumbDev_** rules.\r\n\r\nLet's free our brains for more interesting things, like having ideas and solving problems. \r\n\r\nLet's do **_DumbDev_**.\r\n\r\n  [1]: http://www.phyast.pitt.edu/~micheles/python/plone-hierarchy.png\r\n  [2]: http://www.artima.com/weblogs/viewpost.jsp?thread=246341\r\n",

        "As a web developer, I find myself being asked to make increasing numbers of data visualizations, interactive infographics, and more. d3.js is great, as are many other javascript toolkits that are out there. But if I can write more Python and less JavaScript... well, that makes me happy! \r\n\r\nBokeh is a new Python library for interactive visualization. Its origins are in the data science community, but it has a lot to offer web developers. In this mini-tutorial, I'll run through how to build a data visualization in Bokeh and how to hook it into your web application. This will be a real-world example, that was previously built in d3.js. \r\n\r\nAlong the way, I'll provide tips and tricks that I've discovered in my experience including how Bokeh works wonderfully with the iPython notebook which I use to prototype my visualizations, and many data science people use as their native way to explore data.\r\n\r\nFor those of you who already know a little Bokeh, I'll be covering the new \"actions framework\" that lets you write JS callbacks in your python code so you can do lots of interactions all on the client side.\r\n"

        "Defining a natural hierarchy of classes in Python can be challenging. Features like multiple inheritance, metaclasses, and classmethods can make such hierarchies significantly more powerful. However, these language features are complex and easy to use incorrectly. This talk will cover the best way to put the capabilities of classes to work so you can write Python programs more effectively.\r\n\r\nSpecifically, I'll cover these pieces of advice that I think you should follow:\r\n\r\n1. Initialize Parent Classes with `super`\r\n1. Use Multiple Inheritance Only for Mix-in Utility Classes\r\n1. Validate Subclasses with Metaclasses\r\n1. Register Class Existence with Metaclasses\r\n1. Use `@classmethod` Polymorphism to Construct Objects Generically\r\n\r\nWith each suggestion I'll use code examples to demonstrate why this is the best choice. When there are differences between Python 2 and Python 3, I'll highlight what's different. The goal is that intermediate programmers will learn some Python best practices, experienced programmers will gain confidence in their full use of Python's features."

At the same time, complex projects are evolving their architecture towards containerized microservices. However, most traditional batteries-included web frameworks are not designed for this paradigm.\r\n\r\nThis talk covers some best practices for building REST APIs for private use (in contrast to public ones), focusing on issues like authentication, error handling, validation, and serialization. It will also try to convince you that this might be a good moment to reconsider microframeworks like Flask instead of your favourite opinionated web framework."

On the one hand, some constraints are imposed by the domain, and the risks intrinsically related to machine learning methods, such as handling unstable data, or avoid under/overfitting. On the other hand,  testing scientific code requires additional testing tools (e.g., `numpy.testing`), specifically suited to handle numerical data.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, some of the most famous machine learning techniques will be discudded and analysed from the `testing` point of view, emphasizing that testing would also allow for a better understanding of how the whole learning model works under the hood.\r\n\r\nThe talk is intended for an *intermediate* audience.\r\nThe content of the talk is intended to be mostly practical, and code\r\noriented.

One big exception is runnig a test suite which takes MINUTES on many projects. That is incredibly distracting, frustrating and dragging the whole concept of automated tests down. \r\n\r\nI present a technique and a tool (py.test plugin called \"testmon\") which automatically selects only tests affected by recent changes. Does it sound too good to be true? Python developers rightfully have a suspecting attitude towards any tool which tries to be too clever about their source code. Code completion and symbol searching doesn't need to be 100% reliable but messing with the test suite execution? I show that we can cut test suite execution time significantly but maintain it's reliability."

Second step is the integration of the resulting equations.\r\nFor the first step we use the package sympy which is on a very advanced level to perform symbolic calculation and which supports already Lagrange's and Kane's formalism. The extensions we made are such that a complex mechanical setup can be formulated easily with several lines of python code. The functionality is analogous to well known MBS-tools, with that you can assemble bodies, joints, forces and constraints. Also external forces even in a cosimulation model can be added on top. The second step, the integration is done via ode-integrators implemented in scipy.\r\nFinally for visual validation the results are visualized with the vpython package and for further analytics with matplotlib.\r\n\r\nConclusion: not only highly constrained pendulums with many rods and springs but also driving simulation of passenger cars an be performed with our new extension using python packages off the shelf."

Although I expect my talk to be a bit prospective, I won't certainly be trying to predict the future, but rather showing a glimpse on what I expect we would be doing in the next couple of years for properly leveraging modern architectures (bar unexpected revolutions ;).\r\n\r\nAs an example of library adapting to recent trends in hardware, I will be showing bcolz (https://github.com/Blosc/bcolz), which implements a couple of data containers (and specially a chunked, columnar 'ctable') meant for storing large datasets efficiently.\r\n"

While Spark Core itself is written\r\nin Scala and runs on the JVM, PySpark exposes the Spark programming model to\r\nPython. It defines an API for Resilient Distributed Datasets (RDDs). RDDs are a\r\ndistributed memory abstraction that lets programmers perform in-memory\r\ncomputations on large clusters in a fault-tolerant manner. RDDs are immutable,\r\npartitioned collections of objects. Transformations construct a new RDD from a\r\nprevious one. Actions compute a result based on an RDD. Multiple computation steps\r\nare expressed as directed acyclic graph (DAG). The DAG execution model is \r\na generalization of the Hadoop MapReduce computation model.\r\n\r\nThe Spark DataFrame API was introduced in Spark 1.3. DataFrames envolve Spark's\r\nRDD model and are inspired by Pandas and R data frames. The API provides\r\nsimplified operators for filtering, aggregating, and projecting over large\r\ndatasets. The DataFrame API supports diffferent data sources like JSON\r\ndatasources, Parquet files, Hive tables and JDBC database connections.\r\n\r\nResources:\r\n\r\n- [An Architecture for Fast and General Data Processing on Large Clusters][2] Matei Zaharia\r\n- [Spark][6] Cluster Computing with Working Sets - Matei Zaharia et al.\r\n- [Resilient Distributed Datasets][5] A Fault-Tolerant Abstraction for In-Memory Cluster Computing -Matei Zaharia et al.\r\n- [Learning Spark][3] Lightning Fast Big Data Analysis - Oreilly\r\n- [Advanced Analytics with Spark][4] Patterns for Learning from Data at Scale - Oreilly\r\n\r\n [1]: https://spark.apache.org\r\n[2]: http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/Pubs/TechRpts/2014/EECS-2014-12.pdf\r\n[3]: http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920028512.do\r\n[4]: http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920035091.do\r\n[5]: https://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~matei/papers/2012/nsdi_spark.pdf\r\n[6]: http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~matei/papers/2010/hotcloud_spark.pdf\r\n\r\n"

        "Braintree is a Ruby shop. By default, we use Ruby and Rails for projects. We also use Ruby-based projects for much of our tooling, including puppet, capistrano, and rake. However, we strongly believe in using the right tool for the job. What that means has evolved over ti\r\nme, and I'll discuss what solutions we chose in the past as well as our current choices.\r\n\r\nSo what's it like doing Python at a Ruby shop? You get lots of jokes about language features Ruby has but Python lacks and lots of disbelief that Python will survive the 2/3 split. People also tend to apply the best practices and conventions of Ruby to Python code as if t\r\nhey were the same. Python's major inroad at Braintree has been, surprisingly enough, as a platform for high-concurrency situations. This is a direct result of the power of Tornado as a platform for asynchronous I/O. It also helps that many Python is very approachable and \r\nmany developers have at least some experience with it.\r\n\r\nBraintree has three pieces of our infrastructure using Python and Tornado -- an incoming request proxy; an outgoing request proxy; and a webook delivery service. They've served us well for 3+ years but all suffer from a number of problems. The outdated concurrency feature\r\ns of CPython / Python 2 as well as our lack of experience with and commitment to Tornado have always been an issue. As the meat of the talk, I'll speak in depth about the other issues we've encountered with each of the three applications and our short- and long- term solu\r\ntions to the problems.\r\n\r\nThe state as of the end of 2014 appeared dire for Python at Braintree. All the old Python code in our stack is on the way out, and Python has been specifically recommended agaist for new projects. Our Python client library is used by some of our largest merchants, and is \r\nready for the future by supporting Python 2.6+ and Python 3.3+ in a single codebase. We also have a vibrant Python community at Venmo, our sister company. Both Braintree and Venmo support Python by attending, hosting, sponsoring, and speaking at meetups, conferences, and \r\nother events in Chicago, New York, and elsewhere. At Braintree, our Data Science team uses Python almost exclusively and they're becoming a bigger part of our business every day. We also use Collings and custom tooling written in Python to manage our infrastructure.\r\n"

        "Reahl is a full-featured web framework with a twist: with Reahl you write a web application purely in Python. HTML, JavaScript, CSS and all those cumbersome web technologies (and a few other lower level concerns) are hidden away from you. As far as web frameworks go this is truly a paradigm shift: away from the cobwebs of all the different web technologies, template languages and low-level details -- towards being able to focus on the goals at hand instead, using a single language.\r\n\r\nIn this talk I will give you a brief idea of what Reahl is all about: why it is worthwhile doing, how it works, where we are and what still needs to be done. I hope to convince you that this is an important direction for web frameworks, and of how unique Reahl is. Developing such an abstract framework is an ambitious goal. I'd like to convey the message that what we have achieved so far, and the strategy lessons learnt along the way demonstrate this goal to be realistic and practical.\r\n\r\n"

No special prerequisite knowledge is required. I will start off by discussing my motivation for starting RinohType development, its design goals and the currently available features. This will be followed by an example of how you can use RinohType to render a reStructuredText document to a neat PDF document, highlighting some of the features along the way. Next, we'll explore some of RinohType's internals such as the page layout engine and the style sheet system. We will explore how these can be used in a Python application to create a document from scratch.\r\n\r\nA first RinohType release was recently created. While this preview release is of alpha quality, it should be able to render most reStructuredText documents. It also includes a preliminary Sphinx builder.

        "At some previous EuroPythons, I have taken advantage of people, while eating their food at the conference dinner, to extract money. But don't worry, it's all been in a good cause: in aid of the  [Python Software Foundation][1], which defends the intellectual property of the Python language, and supports Python conferences. We are well represented in the list of the [top PSF donors][2]:\r\n\r\n- 53. EuroPython 2013 Sponsored Massage\r\n- 278. EuroPython 2012 Sponsored Massage\r\n- 499. EuroPython 2011 Sponsored Massage\r\n- 572. EuroPython 2010 Sponsored Massage\r\n- 1331. EuroPython Conference Dinner (sponsored massage)\r\n\r\nIn the early days, I could reasonably visit most tables, offering a shoulder massage in return for a donation. But now, there are too many diners, and not enough hands to do this on my own! **_I need lots of help_**:\r\n\r\n - Doing neck and shoulder massage\r\n - Collecting money in a wine bucket\r\n - Counting and bagging the money\r\n - Exchanging multiple currencies and getting it into the PSF account\r\n - Feeling good that you're doing something for the Python community\r\n\r\n**What do you need to join in?** For everything apart from the massage, common sense, honesty and a sense of humour! Given these, I will be running a short massage workshop. Learn how to relax your own neck and shoulders, with fewer headaches, and less stress from hours spent crouching over a laptop. Then find out the essentials of massaging someone else's neck, shoulders and back for three to four minutes. Become a more valuable member of your work team back home. Help others to relax!\r\n\r\n### Requirements:\r\n\r\n1. Please attend the workshop only if you are actually coming to the conference dinner.\r\n1. You don't need to have particularly strong thumbs and fingers (elbows make a good substitute). But you do need to be not afraid of touching people. Massage is not tickling!\r\n1. Lack of embarrassment about asking for money. More people will pay not to have a massage, than to be massaged -- and that's OK!\r\n1. Join in!\r\n\r\nIf you'd rather not give a massage to diners/donors, no problem: there are lots of other ways to help. But at least you need to join fully in the workshop, so that you experience something of what we'll be asking money for. **A workshop means no onlookers -- all participants!**\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://www.python.org/psf/\r\n  [2]: http://legacy.python.org/psf/donations/\r\n",

        "A few months ago, Guido unfolded PEP 484, which was highlighted at PyCon 2015 as a keynote presentation. This proposal would introduce type hints for Python 3.5. While the debate is still roaring and without taking a side, I believe that there is much to learn from static type-checking systems.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of this talk is to introduce ways that could be used to fully take over the amazing power that comes with static types, inside a dynamic type language such as Python. The talk will go over what exactly a static type system is, and what kind of problem it tries to solve. We will also review Guido's proposal of type hinting, and what it could mean to you. Finally, I will present a few libraries that are available, such as Hypothesis  or various QuickCheck-inspired library that tries to build more robust tests, how they achieve it and their limitations. Throughout the talk, a lot of examples will used to fully illustrate the ideas being explained. \r\n\r\nAt the end of this talk, you should have a better understanding of the wonderful world of type systems, and what it really means to you. It should help you decide wether using type hints will be helpful to you and also if an external library trying to fuzz your tests has its place inside your project "

This talk will show you how to use tests to really drive development by transforming business requirements into tests, and allowing your code to come as their natural consequence.\r\n\r\nToo often this key aspect is neglected and the result is that tests and code are somehow \u201cdisconnected\u201d. The code is not as short and efficient as it could be, and the tests are not as effective. Refactoring is not always easy, and over time all sorts of issues start to come out of the surface.\r\n\r\nHowever, we will show that when TDD is done properly, tests and code merge beautifully into an organic whole that fulfills the business requirements, and provides all sorts of advantages: your code is minimal, easy to amend and extend, readable, clean. Your tests will be effective, short and focused, and allow for light-hearted refactoring and excellent coverage.\r\n\r\nWe will provide enough information and examples to spark the curiosity of the novice, and satisfy the need of a deeper insight for the intermediate, and help you immediately benefit from this transformative technique that is still often underestimated and misunderstood."

        "Ever feel like your open source project could be better tested? Lack of tests holding you back from contributors but you don\u2019t know where to start? You\u2019re not alone.\r\n\r\n[\u201cAdopt pytest month\u201d][1] was held in April 2015. [Pytest][2] volunteers were paired with open source software projects, to find a path to better testing with pytest. Projects varied from  libraries/command line utilities, to a browser, to a complex Django app. In some cases converting existing tests was necessary, in others writing the first tests in existence for non-trivial amounts of code. Two projects were open sourced specifically to take part in \u201cadopt pytest month\u201d. What began as an experiment in increasing software audience proved to be an interesting exercise in strengthening community and most valuable of all, provided a newcomer\u2019s perspective to veteran contributors.\r\n\r\nThis talk will discuss what worked well with \u201cadopt pytest month\u201d, what didn\u2019t, what we learned about pytest and what you could take away for your open source project, be it an improved testing environment or an improved contributor community. A basic knowledge of testing and pytest will be useful.\r\n\r\n  [1]: http://pytest.org/latest/adopt.html\r\n  [2]: http://pytest.org/latest/\r\n"

        "Traditional Python profiling tools have limitations.  Standard tools like **cProfile** and most all third party tools (like **Python Tools** plugin for Microsoft Visual Studio) suffer from common flaws.  First, the profiling overhead is high (up to 50%).  Second, the  information provided is \u201cfunction-level\u201d i.e. the  tool shows how much time was spent within a function, but not actionable \u201cline-level\u201d information to show which exact lines are _the bottleneck_ in a function.  Adding \u201cline-level\u201d information to most tools causes the application to run even slower. Third, some tools require modification of the application source code to enable profiling thus disrupting development.\r\n\r\nThis talk presents an experimental Python profiler.  It typically has less than 15% overhead, shows line-level information and does not require modification of application source code.  Experiments using it resulted in performance gains of 2x and more.  Of course results vary by application, but in a typical application there may be quick optimizations easily identified by this type of profiler.\r\n\r\nThe talk will briefly describe the basics of what, why and how to profile.  The profiler\u2018s use and results will be shown in the presentation with examples based on real-life applications.  Previous experience of working with profilers and trying to optimize an application is a plus, but not required, to gain a better appreciation of the work presented.",

Non-Blocking IO while doing tasks and not wait for IO. This also helps us handle a lot many connections than we possibly could with Blocking IO. Python supports Non-Blocking IO, but we always use some existing 3rd party library that hides all the gory details and makes it all look like black magic to the uninitiated. But there is nothing like black magic.\r\n\r\nThis presentation will be an introductory talk focused at explaining how Non-Blocking IO works, which is the basis of libraries like Gevent, Tornado and Twisted.

They reduce the amount of work needed to make requests and sometimes, only sometimes prevent the developer from dealing with extensive documentations. It\u2019s common to encounter libs that require not only the study of their own documentation, but also the APIs one, duplicating the needed work. This is caused because wrappers do not follow a design pattern, each developer creates it\u2019s own design, coding style and use their preferred tools.   \r\n\r\n[Tapioca][1] is what can be called: \"a wrapper generator\u201d. Creating API wrappers with Tapioca is extremely easy and fast. For example, it took 1 hour to write the full wrapper for the [Parse.com][2] REST API. But this is not the more important thing, Tapioca libs have a similar interface so once understood how they work, developers can work with any other without the need to learn a new interface.    \r\n\r\nTapioca is also thought to comply with REST features and takes HATEOAS (Hypermedia as the engine of application state) seriously, so \u201cfollowing\u201d links and pagination are natively supported. Explorability is also a key concept and developers are encouraged to play with Tapioca packages and find their way through APIs before writing their final code.

        "In static unit testing, the output of a function is compared to a precomputed result. Even though such unit tests may apparently cover all the code in a function, they might cover only a small subset of behaviours of the function. This potentially allows bugs such as heartbleed to stay undetected. Dynamic unit tests using fuzzing, which allows you to specify a data generation template, can make your test suite more robust.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, we demonstrate fuzzing using the hypothesis library.\r\nHypothesis is a Python library to automatically generate test data based on a template.\r\nData is generated using a strategy. A strategy specifies how data is generated, and how falsifying examples can be simplified. Hypothesis provides strategies for Python's built-in data types, and is easily customizable.Since test data is generated automatically, we can not compare against pre-computed results. Instead, tests are usually done on invariants of functions. We give an overview of such invariants.\r\n\r\nFinally, we demonstrate how we use fuzzing to test machine learning algorithms at Blue Yonder."

The Myo Armband is a device that uses the electrical activity in your muscles to wirelessly control your computer, phone, and tablet, which is especially useful when your hands are \"tied\" or dirty.  This device will be used to navigate through the presentation. The Leap Motion Controller tracks both hands in front of the screen.  From a web developer\u2019s perspective, both devices allows us to use gestures, previously  restricted to touch devices, on desktops. EyeTribe is an affordable eye-tracking device. \r\n\r\nThe talk will briefly cover setting up SDKs and python wrappers, and then focus on possible uses in daily life, business and, of course, web app development. Code examples will be included. In addition, the trade-offs between processing this new type of input data in the client versus processing input on the server will be discussed.\r\n"

From there, we'll extract features and train a model using scikit-learn. This will bring us to our first submission. We'll then learn how to structure the problem for offline evaluation and use scikit-learn's clean model API to train many models simultaneously and perform feature selection and hyperparameter optimization.\r\n\r\nAt the end of session, attendees will have time to work on their own to improve their models and make multiple submissions to get to the top of the leaderboard, just like in a real competition.

        "**Description:** Over the course of the 2.5 hours of this workshop you will learn how to leverage both Python and MongoDB to build highly scalable, asynchronous applications based on microservices architecture. We will be building from scratch several different \"exotic\" services, using a variety of datasets, that together we can mashup into a consolidated application using our own laptops. \r\n\r\nWe will start by introducing several  technologies that we will be using (e.g. Python, Flask, MongoDB, AngularJS) and take a ten-thousand foot  overview of micro services architecture.\r\nIn the second half of the workshop, we will break into teams that will each take charge in implementing a microservice that will comprise our final application. \r\n\r\nThis a fully hands-on workshop.\r\n\r\n**Learning objectives:** \r\n\r\n - Benefits of microservice architectures\r\n\r\n - MongoDB schema design \r\n\r\n - MongoDB query optimization and profiling \r\n\r\n - Basic understanding of AngularJS \r\n\r\n - Flask as REST API platform\r\n\r\n**Target Audience:**\r\nThis workshop is recommended to software developers eager to understand more about MongoDB and how to build async calls. Coding skills and basic understanding of Python is required. Prior experience with AngularJS and Flask is welcomed.\r\n\r\n**Technical Requirement:**\r\nThe attendee should bring their own laptop with MongoDB and Python (>2.7) installed. One should have administration grants over their system because we will need to expose ports and other communications to the network. The datasets and project instructions will be provided on site.\r\n\r\n"

        "A workshop introducing participants to physical computing with Python and Raspberry Pi.\r\n\r\nLearn how to build applications with Python that interact with the physical world - using the Pi's GPIO (general purpose input & output) pins and its camera module and their respective Python libraries.\r\n\r\nWe'll start simple - flashing LEDs, using push buttons, basic use of the camera module, then introduce sensors such as infra-red motion detectors, temperature sensors and light sensors, then we'll build interactive applications (embedded apps, desktop apps and web apps) using the sensors and camera module for a variety of different purposes.\r\n\r\nEmbedded or physical computing is not just for C programmers or hardcore Linux engineers - I'll show you how to get up and running with your first physical world application and show how easy it is to control GPIOs and the camera module from the language you know and love (and can read). This will prepare you for making your own hardware project idea a reality - build a security system, a robot or a home automation system.\r\n\r\nThis workshop is well suited to beginners with a basic understanding of Python code, but is also suitable for those more experienced with Python but with little or no experience with physical computing.",

        "Transducers \u2013 a portmanteau of \u2018transform reducers\u2019 \u2013 are a new functional programming concept, which were first introduced into the Clojure programming language.  Although transducers are actually pretty straightforward in retrospect, wrapping your brain around them can be challenging. \r\n\r\nTransducers allow us to fuse multiple data processing operations together so they can be applied in a single pass over a data series \u2013 similar to how Python generator functions allow us to process iterable series.  However, unlike generator functions they are completely decoupled from the data series abstraction and can be used on eager sequences, lazy iterables, coroutine-based push events and events such as those modelled by Reactive Extensions for Python (RxPy). \r\n\r\nIn this workshop, we introduce transducers by implementing them from scratch in Python 3. We\u2019ll start with the familiar staples of functional programming, map(), filter() and reduce(), and derive transducers from first principles. We\u2019ll work towards a set of general tools which works with eager collections, lazy \u2018pull\u2019 sequences, and coroutine \u2018push\u2019 event streams and RxPy. Along the way we\u2019ll cover stateful transducers and transducer composition, demonstrating that transducers are both more general, and more fundamental, than the functional programming tools baked into Python and many other languages.\r\n\r\nThere are no prerequisites for this workshop as we stick to core Python 3 language features although an enthusiasm for a functional programming style will be sure to help attendees get the most out of this session.",

        "Highly-constrained, large-dimensional, and non-linear optimizations are found at the root of most of today\u2019s forefront problems in statistics, quantitative finance, risk, operations research, materials design, and other predictive sciences. Tools for optimization, however, have not changed much in the past 40 years -- until very recently. The abundance of parallel computing resources has stimulated a shift away from using reduced models to solve statistical and predictive problems, and toward more direct methods for solving high-dimensional nonlinear optimization problems.\r\n\r\nThis tutorial will introduce modern tools for solving optimization problems -- beginning with traditional methods, and extending to solving high-dimensional non-convex optimization problems with highly nonlinear constraints. We will start by introducing the cost function, and it\u2019s use in local and global optimization. We will then address how to monitor and diagnose your optimization convergence and results, tune your optimizer, and utilize compound termination conditions. This tutorial will discuss building and applying box constraints, penalty functions, and symbolic constraints. We will then demonstrate methods to efficiently reduce search space through the use of robust optimization constraints.  Real-world inverse problems can be expensive, thus we will show how to enable your optimization to seamlessly leverage parallel computing. Large-scale optimizations also can greatly benefit from efficient solver restarts and the saving of state. This tutorial will cover using asynchronous computing for results caching and archiving, dynamic real-time optimization, and dimensional reduction. Next we will discuss new optimization methods that leverage parallel computing to perform blazingly-fast global optimizations and n-dimensional global searches. Finally, we will close with applications of global optimization in statistics and quantitative finance.\r\n\r\nThe audience need not be an expert in optimization, but should have interest in solving hard real-world optimization problems.  We will introduce the [_mystic_][1] optimization framework -- then begin with a walk through some introductory optimizations, learning how to build confidence in understanding your results. By the end of the tutorial, participants will have working knowledge of how to use modern constrained optimization tools, how to enable their solvers to leverage high-performance parallel computing, and how to utilize legacy data and surrogate models in statistical and predictive risk modeling.\r\n\r\n*PREREQUISITES*: This tutorial will assume attendees have basic knowledge of _python_ and _numpy_, and is intended for scientific developers who are interested in utilizing optimization to solve real-world problems in statistics, quantitative finance, and predictive sciences.

        "Highly-constrained, large-dimensional, and non-linear optimizations are found at the root of most of today\u2019s forefront problems in statistics, quantitative finance, risk, operations research, materials design, and other predictive sciences. Tools for optimization, however, have not changed much in the past 40 years -- until very recently. The abundance of parallel computing resources has stimulated a shift away from using reduced models to solve statistical and predictive problems, and toward more direct methods for solving high-dimensional nonlinear optimization problems.\r\n\r\nThis tutorial will introduce modern tools for solving optimization problems -- beginning with traditional methods, and extending to solving high-dimensional non-convex optimization problems with highly nonlinear constraints. We will start by introducing the cost function, and it\u2019s use in local and global optimization. We will then address how to monitor and diagnose your optimization convergence and results, tune your optimizer, and utilize compound termination conditions. This tutorial will discuss building and applying box constraints, penalty functions, and symbolic constraints. We will then demonstrate methods to efficiently reduce search space through the use of robust optimization constraints.  Real-world inverse problems can be expensive, thus we will show how to enable your optimization to seamlessly leverage parallel computing. Large-scale optimizations also can greatly benefit from efficient solver restarts and the saving of state. This tutorial will cover using asynchronous computing for results caching and archiving, dynamic real-time optimization, and dimensional reduction. Next we will discuss new optimization methods that leverage parallel computing to perform blazingly-fast global optimizations and n-dimensional global searches. Finally, we will close with applications of global optimization in statistics and quantitative finance.\r\n\r\nThe audience need not be an expert in optimization, but should have interest in solving hard real-world optimization problems.  We will introduce the [_mystic_][1] optimization framework -- then begin with a walk through some introductory optimizations, learning how to build confidence in understanding your results. By the end of the tutorial, participants will have working knowledge of how to use modern constrained optimization tools, how to enable their solvers to leverage high-performance parallel computing, and how to utilize legacy data and surrogate models in statistical and predictive risk modeling.\r\n\r\nintroduction to optimization (30 min)\r\n-------------------------------------\r\n - the cost function\r\n - local and global optimization\r\n - monitoring and diagnosing convergence and optimization results\r\n - solver tuning and compound termination conditions\r\n - Exercise(s)\r\n\r\npenalty functions and constraints (30 min)\r\n------------------------------------------\r\n - box constraints\r\n - applying penalty functions\r\n - reducing search space with constraints\r\n - applying symbolic constraints\r\n - Exercise(s)\r\n\r\nleverage asynchronous and parallel computing (30 min)\r\n-----------------------------------------------------\r\n - parallel function evaluations and solver iterations \r\n - solver restarts and saving state\r\n - dynamic real-time optimization\r\n - automated dimensional reduction\r\n - Exercise(s)\r\n\r\nensemble optimization and global searches (30 min)\r\n--------------------------------------------------\r\n - blazingly-fast global optimization\r\n - using global search to find all minima, maxima, and turning points\r\n - building a surrogate model through optimal surface interpolation\r\n - Exercise(s)\r\n\r\noptimization in parameter sensitivity, statistics, and risk modeling (30 min)\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n - the cost metric\r\n - statistical and probabilistic constraints\r\n - information constraints from surrogate models and legacy data\r\n - application to quantitative finance and statistics\r\n - Exercise(s)\r\n\r\nPREREQUISITES:\r\nThis tutorial will assume attendees have basic knowledge of _python_ and _numpy_, and is intended for scientific developers who are interested in utilizing optimization to solve real-world problems in statistics, quantitative finance, and predictive sciences.

        "We propose a web BI dashboard system developed for companies operating in the big market composed by several point of sales (POS) and providing services as stocking, distribution logistics, commercial support and promotional actions. \r\n\r\nWe have endowed the infrastructure with a set of statistical machine learning tools typical of high throughput bioinformatics, e.g., clustering procedures for time-series. Machine learning functionalities are actionable from on-line graphs, such as biclustering panels in which subset of retails and sales categories can be interactively selected. Currently 250 million entries are managed from the sales stream within the system. Network analysis (detection of community structure and co-occurrence patterns) combined with geospatial and socio-economic data are being developed as strategic tools.\r\n\r\nThe system is implemented as a web-based Django framework deployed on a AWS machine, using Celery and Redis to distribute tasks. This scalable framework can be accessed through a web interface from the strategic marketing and R&D departments and other directive figures; a similar and leaner interface is available for the individual POS owners. The web interface integrates Javascript libraries to obtain interactive displays connecting machine learning and data exploration (D3js, Highcharts, Sigma.js, Heatmap.js, leaflet, InCHlib). In particular we fork the django-highchart repository to improve functionalities available for the Django framework. Actionable dendrogram structures and sunburst plots allow the handling of big taxonomies typical of the category managment reference structures. Internally, the statistical machine learning methods are deployed as stored procedures for a PostgreSQL/PostGIS database, powered by the PL/R and PL/Python extensions. "

        "Python is a popular and widely used programming language but its use is limited in certain cases. Concurrency is one of those cases when people look for an alternative. It's actually what happened at the start-up I work at before I joined. The co-founders looked for a solution in a functional programming language and chose to use Clojure. Functional programming is now implemented in most programming languages and functional languages are getting more and more popular. For a junior developer learning a functional language as her/his second programming language completely make sense and I was up for the challenge! Clojure is not so different from Python in its readability and might be one of the easiest functional languages to learn for a Pythonista. I would like to share my tips and tools I used for learning and contributing to a code base in Clojure.\r\n\r\nThere are several online resources to understand the paradigm of functional programming. The same can be said regarding Clojure but a good way to learn aside from diving into a codebase is to take part in a community. The Clojurians are much fewer than the Pythonistas but they are equally friendly. They are looking forward to grow their community and their meetups and dojos are well suited to beginners. At some point you have to throw yourself into this sea of parentheses so you'd better be well equipped! In that aim Emacs is by far the best suited text editor. After customising it with the right tools you shall fear no orphan parens!\r\nThis experience will help you progress and focus on writing more concise code with short and clear functions. You will be more comfortable and curious about implementing the functional features of the Python language. Getting always closer to the Zen of Python: \" Beautiful is better than ugly. Explicit is better than implicit. Simple is better than complex. Complex is better than complicated. Flat is better than nested. Sparse is better than dense. Readability counts. .... \" "

Soudry, R. B. Yehezkael\r\n\r\nMulti-core CPUs are abundant and utilizing them effectively requires programmers to parallelize CPU-intensive code. To facilitate this, we have developed EFL, a deterministic parallel programming tool. \r\nThe parallel parts of a program are written as EFL-blocks, which are embedded into a sequential host language program. The sequential parts of the program are written in the host language, outside the EFL blocks.   \r\nAn EFL pre-compiler translates EFL blocks into parallel Python code.  EFL may be embedded in any host language by writing an appropriate pre-compiler. The EFL pre-compiler is being developed for other host programming languages (C++, Java, C#, Fortran, etc) as well as for other parallel platforms (DTM/MPI4PY, etc. ).\r\nHere we present the parallel programming constructs of EFL, such as parallel assignments, parallel for-loops, etc., and some examples of using EFL to implement Parallel Programming Design Patterns. \r\n",

This will include: practice opportunities, Python libraries for game-building, and useful programming concepts.\r\n\r\nIf there are the facilities (small table and access to power) I will demonstrate **one** game during the poster session.
